descriptionId: "For each project risk, estimate the range of possible consequences\
  \ (in terms of cost or schedule increases) associated with that particular risk.\
  \  Use an 80% certainty band, meaning there is a 10% chance the consequence is lower\
  \ than the range provided and a 10% chance the consequence is higher than the range\
  \ provided.  For example, if you anticipate with 80% certainty that unexpected site\
  \ conditions would result in cost increases of between $100k-$700k, the low (p10)\
  \ end of the range would be $100k, the high (p90) end of the range would be $700k,\
  \ and the expected consequence (p50) would be, say, $500k, or your best estimate."
