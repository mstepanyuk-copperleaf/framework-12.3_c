descriptionId: "For each project risk, estimate the range of possible consequences\
  \ (in terms of cost or schedule increases) associated with that particular risk.\
  \  Use an 80% certainty band, meaning there is a 10% chance the consequence is lower\
  \ than the range provided and a 10% chance the consequence is higher than the range\
  \ provided.  For example, if you anticipate with 80% certainty that unexpected site\
  \ conditions would result in schedule increases of between 10-70 days, the low (p10)\
  \ end of the range would be 10 days, the high (p90) end of the range would be 70\
  \ days, and the expected consequence (p50) would be, say, 50 days, or your best\
  \ estimate."
